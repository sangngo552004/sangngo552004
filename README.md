# 👋 Hi, I'm Sang!

I'm a **student developer** who loves exploring different areas of tech — from **Backend Development** to **DevOps**, **Cloud**, and even a bit of **AI**.  
Still figuring out my path, but I really enjoy learning new things every day 🚀

### 🧠 My Journey So Far

I started my journey with Java backend development, drawn to the discipline and structure it offers. Over time, I’ve explored other backend frameworks like Express and Gin to broaden my skill set and future career opportunities.

While some may call this “learning too many things at once,” I see it differently — I’m still young, and I believe it’s the perfect time to experiment, explore, and discover what truly resonates with me. This mindset has led me to dive into Cloud technologies, especially AWS, which in turn opened doors to DevOps, GenAI, and other adjacent fields.

Even if I may not end up working directly in DevOps, GenAI, or Cloud, every step of learning feels meaningful. It helps me connect knowledge across domains and collaborate with a wider community — and I genuinely enjoy the process, one discovery at a time.
