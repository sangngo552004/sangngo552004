# 👋 Hi, I'm Sang!

I'm a **student developer** who loves exploring different areas of tech — from **Backend Development** to **DevOps**, **Cloud**, and even a bit of **AI**.  
Still figuring out my path, but I really enjoy learning new things every day 🚀

### 🧩 What I'm Learning

- **Languages:** Python 🐍 (for LeetCode & problem solving), Java ☕ (Spring Boot), JavaScript / TypeScript ⚡ (Node.js, React), Go 🐹 (currently building a TodoList project)
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Express.js, React, Gin
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB
- **Currently Exploring:** DevOps, AWS Cloud ☁️, and Network Security (Cisco, GNS3)
- **Also Curious About:** LLMs, MCP, RAG, and the new wave of AI tech 🤖

### 🧠 My Journey So Far

I mainly focus on **backend development**, building REST APIs and experimenting with different architectures.  
Recently, I’ve been diving into **DevOps** and **Cloud**, learning how to deploy and automate stuff.  
I also study **networking and security** to understand how everything connects under the hood.  

Even though I’m learning many things at once (and not a master of any yet 😅),  
I truly love the process — one step at a time, one bug at a time.

### 🎯 What I Do in My Free Time

- Practicing **LeetCode** problems  
- Studying **System Design** & **Low-Level Design** concepts  
- Exploring new tools or frameworks just for fun  
- Watching tech talks or reading about AI trends
